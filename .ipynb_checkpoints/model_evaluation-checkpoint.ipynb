    "\n",
    "These descriptions are designed to make sense without mathematical definitions, but we include them for specificity. We'll use the symbols $w$ for a word, $k$ for a topic, and $d$ for a document. Several metrics count tokens. For these we define variables $N_{d,w,k}$ as the number of times word $w$ occurs in document $d$ assigned to topic $k$, $N_{d,k}$ as $\\sum_wN_{d,w,k}$. Other metrics involve document frequencies. $D(w)$ is the number of documents that contain at least one token of type $w$, and $D(w_1,w_2)$ is the number of documents that contain at least one $w_1$ and one $w_2$. Finally, we define $W_k$ to be the $N$ most probable words in topic $k$. $ùüô(p)$ is equal to 1 if predicate $p$ is true, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokens.** This metric measures the number of word tokens currently assigned to the topic $N_k=\\sum_dN_{d,k}$. Comparing this number to the sum of the token counts for all topics will give you the proportion of the corpus assigned to the topic. If you are using optimized hyperparameters this number will vary considerably across topics; otherwise it will be roughly the same for all topics. We usually find topics most interesting if they are not on the extremes of this range. Small numbers (relative to other topics) are often a sign that a topic may not be reliable: we don't have enough observations to get a good sense of the topic's word distribution. Large numbers may also be bad: extremely frequent topics are often \"not-quite-stopwords\". For example, in the sample model the largest topic is \"time number term part system form\"."

In the example topic model, the topics \"list links history external information site\" and \"game team league player players football games\" have roughly the same number of tokens, but the \"list\" topic has much higher entropy. It occurs to a small degree in many documents, while the \"game\" topic occurs a lot in a smaller number of documents.

    "\n",
    "This metric looks for \"bursty\" words within topics. We compare two distributions over words using Jensen-Shannon distance. The first distribution $P(w|k)‚àùN_{k,w}$ is the usual topic-word distribution proportional to the number of tokens of type w that are assigned to the topic. The second distribution $Q(w|k)‚àù\\sum_dùüô(N_{d,w,k}>0)$ is proportional to the number of documents that contain at least one token of type w that is assigned to the topic. A words that occurs many times in only a few documents may appear prominently in the sorted list of words, but may not be a good representative word for the topic. This metric compares the number of times a word occurs in a topic (measured in tokens) and the number of documents the word occurs in as that topic (instances of the word assigned to other topics are not counted). The highest ranked topic in this metric is the \"polish poland danish denmark sweden swedish na norway norwegian sk red\" topic, suggesting that those ill-fitting words may be isolated in a few documents. Although this metric has the same goal as coherence, the two don't appear to correlate well: bursty words aren't necessarily unrelated to the topic, they're just unusually frequent in certain contexts."

    "## 9. Rank 1 Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Some topics are specific, while others aren't really \"topics\" but language that comes up because we are writing in a certain context. Academic writing will talk about \"paper abstract data\", and a Wikipedia article will talk about \"list links history\". The difference is often measurable in terms of burstiness. A content-ful topic will occur in relatively few documents, but when it does, it will produce a lot of tokens. A \"background\" topic will occur in many documents and have a high overall token count, but never produce many tokens in any single document. This metric counts the frequency at which a given topic is the single most frequent topic in a document. Specific topics like \"music album band song\" or \"cell cells disease dna blood treatment\" are the \"rank 1\" topic in many documents. High token-count topics often have few rank-1 documents. This metric is often useful as a way to identify corpus-specific stopwords. But rarer topics can also have few rank-1 documents: \"day year calendar days years month\" is a representative example ‚Äî topics for days of the week and units of measurement often appear in documents as a distinct discourse, but they are rarely the focus of a document.\n"
